The WP-OBS (Wordpress Online Booking System) is an Online Appointments Booking System Plugin suitable for Wordpress running Sites that will enable business owners and customers alike to manage or make bookings/appointments directly from the business Website. 
A time saving feature which many customers may appreciate is that customers do not need to set up an account in order to proceed to make a booking.The WP-OBS will allow business owners to add/customise services they provide, add/remove  employees who provide them together with relative prices and the services duration.
 
Customers are able to book appointments online directly from the Business website or from a Facebook page [this feature requires the Pro version] and all functionalities are simple and user friendly.This plugin is extremely flexible: it allows business owners to Approve/Decline appointments on the go by following a simple confirm/decline link which is sent to the Admin email address (set up by the user). 
The booking form is also very flexible, it allows for a full translation which means that the WP-OBS can be used in almost any language other than English (currently it supports all Latin characters, but we will strive to expand this to include other languages in future).
